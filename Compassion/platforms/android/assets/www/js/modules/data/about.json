{"paragraph":" Welcome to the Embodying Compassion in Buddhist Art app. This multimedia guide introduces you to Avalokiteshvara, the Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion. Download it to visit the exhibition remotely or use it as you walk through the show at The Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, Vassar College, from April 23 to June 28, 2015. The exhibition features outstanding examples of Indian, Nepalese, Tibetan, Chinese and Japanese art, including paintings, sculptures, texts, and ritual objects. See how Avalokiteshvara took on many different faces, names, and gender identities over time, becoming Guanyin in China, Kannon in Japan, Karunamaya in Nepal, and Chenrezig in Tibet. His Sanskrit name means “Lord Who Looks Down.” In East Asia, Avalokiteshvara became known as “Lord Who Perceives the Sounds of the World.” In every form, the bodhisattva offers the possibility that all beings—without exception—be free from suffering. "}, 
{"paragraph":"The app includes high-resolution reproductions of the twenty-seven works in the exhibition, as well as dozens of comparative images and a rich array of interpretative texts, audio commentary, a glossary of terms, and pronunciation guides. We invite you to explore the works, which are organized into three thematic categories—Image, Pilgrimage, Practice. Follow Avalokiteshvara as he travels from his birthplace in India to the Himalayas and East Asia, becoming one of the most revered figures in Buddhism."}
