    "text":"The objects in this section demonstrate the many ways that artists have represented Avolokiteshvara throughout the centuries. The bodhisattva's iconography initially emerged in India almost two thousand years ago. At first he played a subsidiary role as attendant to the buddhas Shakyamuni or Amitabha and then became an independent focus of veneration. In East Asia, Avalokiteshvara took on feminine maternal forms. The bodhisattva's gracefull sitting and standing postures, gestures, attributes and idealized body are fundamentally iconic and symbolic. Each visual aspect points to an essential Buddhist ideal, especially the inseparability of compassion and wisdom. An outstretched hand or an upraised teaching gesture express these values; the white color and lotus convery purity, while the iwllow symbolizes healing abilities. Multiple heads and limbs indicate esoteric forms, signifying increased power. Avalokiteshvara's most identifiable attribute is a small buddha on his crown, an icon of his spiritual father Amitabha.",

    {"about":"Welcome to the Embodying Compassion in Buddhist Art app. This multimedia guide introduces you to Avalokiteshvara, the Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion. Download it to visit the exhibition remotely or use it as you walk through the show at the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, Vassar College, from April 23 to June 28, 2015. The exhibition features outstanding examples of Indian, Nepalese, Tibetan, Chinese and Japanese art, including paintings, sculptures, texts, and ritual objects. See how Avalokiteshvara took on many different faces, names, and gender identities over time, becoming Guanyin in China, Kannon in Japan, Karunamaya in Nepal, and Chenrezig in Tibet. His Sanskrit name means “Lord Who Looks Down.” In East Asia, Avalokiteshvara became known as “Lord Who Perceives the Sounds of the World.” In every form, the bodhisattva offers the possibility that all beings—without exception—be free from suffering. The app includes high-resolution reproductions of the twenty-seven works in the exhibition, as well as dozens of comparative images and a rich array of interpretative texts, audio commentary, videos, a glossary of terms, and pronunciation guides. We invite you to explore the works, which are organized into three thematic categories—Image, Pilgrimage, Practice. Follow Avalokiteshvara as he travels from his birthplace in India to the Himalayas and East Asia, becoming one of the most revered figures in Buddhism.
