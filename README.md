Embodying Compassion 
===

This Android and iOS app is meant to enhance the first transcultural exhibition in America solely devoted to Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. It will serve as an onsite guide for those who have the privilege to experience the Bodhisattva exhibit by providing contextual content. And, this contextual content will also provide those unable to attend the exhibition in person a remote gateway to experience it, increasing the number of people impacted by the exhibit.
